	<h1>What trigged my fishing interest?</h1>
	<p>Growing up my dad and I would go pan fishing on lakes and flowages around our cabin.  Once sophomore year of high school came around, I found most of them were big fishermen.  They
lent me some of their gear and I went walleye fishing with them on the Fox River in Green Bay.  The water was cold and it was snowing, but I fell in love with all the adventures that came with it.
Since them me and that group of guys have been on many fishing trips, and I have even convinced my family to take a "vacation" to Ely Minnesota a honey hole for all fishermen. </P>
	
	<h2>Ely Minnesota</h2>
	<p>Ely is just south of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area(BWCA), which is a bunch of lakes that are protected.  These protections range from not allowing cans, to 25 HP motor limits, to no motors allowed
at all.  We rented a cabin on a lake that came with some canoes and a private "boat landing" (gravel that was borderline big enough to launch a small boat).  While up there me and my Dad did a lot of 
fishing but one of the highligths remains a day 9 mile canoe paddle that took us to the border of Canada and back.  More information on the BWCA visit: <a href="https://bwca.com/" target="_blank">https://bwca.com/</a>.</p>

	<h2>Willow Flowage</h2>
	<p>With my friends from high school we planned a trip to Willow Flowage in Hazelhurst, WI.  This body of water was a river that was had dams placed on it for logging.  The result is a 
huge body of water that holds huge amounts of walleye and pan fish.  Due to the flowages massive size, there are many campsites that are first come first serve along the river.  For more information on camping

	<h2>Small trips and Day outtings</h2>
	<p>As fun as fishig trips can be, it is more times we find ourselves out on Lake Tomohawk or on the Fox River.  Some of the best fishing is done with the least amout of planning.  
My friends and I have caught many personal bests and firsts on the Fox River.  For example I have caught my personal best sheephead, carp, and walleye  out of the Fox, and my friend Ryan caught his first
musky.<p>
