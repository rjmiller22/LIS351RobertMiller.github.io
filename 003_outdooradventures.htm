	<h1>Outside of fishing, I enjoy hunting, skiing, and camping!</h1>
	<p>Outside of the fishing trip me and my girlfriend camping on Clear Lake just north of Lake Tomohawk Wisconsin.  There we went kayaking, swimming, fishing, and hiking.  Also, I went camping
at Potawatomi State Park in Sturgeon Bay.  Lucky for me I don't have to go far from Green Bay to find myself in the woods.  My cabin is a perfect place to explore new areas of the woods and find new places to hike.
My friends that I go fishing with are also into hunting and just being in nature.  Our most recent adventure was finding ourselves squirrel and woodcock hunting on land south of Stevens Point.  We have also walked around
woods by Crivitz, Denmark, and Kellnersville.</p>
