	<h1>What sparked my interest in cars?</h1>
	<p>My dad bought a 1967 Pontiac GTO when is was 18 and has kept it to this day.  For as long as I can remember it was kept in a 2 stall garage at my parents cabin, we all refered to it
as the "GTO Garage".  Over the years we have accumlated a couple other cars in desperate need of repair.  The list includes a 1967 Pontiac Grand Prix convertable, 1967 Catalalina Station Wagon,
and the project truck me and my dad have worked on since I was 14 a 1972 K20 Chevy Truck.  We have taken the truck from a rust bucket with a floor you can see straight down to the ground in, to a
solid piece of metal with a beautiful orange paint job.  However as much as I enjoy driving it, a 48 year old machine does have it constant need for repairs which leaves room for daily drivers.</p>

	<h1>What cars have I owned?</h1>
	<p>When I turned 16 I got my first car a 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan.  My parents both had one for hauling my siblings and I around with our friends and they made great cars to take up to the
families cabin in Crivitz Wisconsin.  However, the first van lasted me about nine months as we still took it up north and pulled our boat and trailer with it, the van finally died with 243,000 miles
on it.  My mom then got a new car and I recieved her van as a my second daily driver.  However this one needed a lot more work, as the front end was shot,  I put struts, tie rods, ball joints, control
arms, rack and pinion, sway bar links and bushing, and one wheel bearing.  To finish it off I bought a new set of tire for it.  Sadly, the van died a few weeks later with me only getting limited miles 
out of the work and money I just put into it.  This left me looking for a new daily driver and being a car guy, I didn't want another minivan.  I went out and found  a 2008 Lexus IS 250, this car was 
great for what I was doing at the time, putting a lot of miles on due to school and work.  However, with my purchase of kayak and found love for camping, my Lexus turned out to not be the right car
for me.  I found a clean one owner 2006 Honda CRV which I bought roughly a two months ago (September 2020).  I am currenlty coming up with a list of things I want to do to it, ranging from a roof rack
to LED pod lights.</p>

	<h2>Benefits of my car hobby</h2>
		<p>Since just after I turned 18 I have been a auto tech at Mills Fleet Farm.  This job has tought me a lot about the suspesion of cars, best way to replace parts, how to diagnose worn parts,
and increase my general knowledge of late model cars.  It has also been a very rewarding job in terms of monetary value and the friends I've made over the past couple of years.  Outside of my job, it is very
nice to share a passion with my dad creating memories I will have forever.</p>
